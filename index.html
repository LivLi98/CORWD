<p> I want this class to be a life changing experince for me. Not just
    physcially but mentally. I finally want to take control of my own
life and not living throught anyone else. I have big dreams for becoming
a movie dircector and having my very own movie being played in threaters. 
( it's going to come true). I also have dreams of me traveling around the 
world, visiting the 7 Wonders of the World.
